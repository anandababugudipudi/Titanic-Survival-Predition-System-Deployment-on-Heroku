    "# **Titanic Survival Prediction Using Machine Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "The [RMS Titanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic) was known as the unsinkable ship and was the largest, most luxurious passenger ship of its time. Sadly, the British ocean liner sank on April 15, 1912, killing over 1500 people while just 705 survived. In this article, we will analyze the Titanic data set and make predictions to see whether passengers on board the ship would survive or not.\n",
